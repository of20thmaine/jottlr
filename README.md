<img width="42" src="app-icon.png" align="left" /> **Jottlr** is a free, open source note-taking, list-making, and organization application. It serves as a collection point for ideas which are "jotted down" in the app. These jotted down ideas are easily triaged into any number of collections- conceptually identical to notebooks. But unlike a notebook the notes in a collection can be quickly arranged and rearranged into any number of ordered subsets called positionals. Collections and their positionals are shown with any number of highly customizable themes. If you want ordered or unordered lists, or simple document like formats, Jottlr will let you do it with its built in theme editor.
