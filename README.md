<img width="32" src="app-icon.png" align="left" /> **Jottlr** is a free, open source note-taking, list-making, and organization application. It's purpose is to serve as a collection point for ideas which get "jotted down" into app.

These jotted down ideas can then be easily triaged into any number of collections- conceptually identical to notebooks. But unlike a notebook the notes in a collection can be arranged into any number of ordered subsets (we call these 'positionals').

Collections and their positionals can be displayed any number of highly customizable themes. If you want ordered or unordered lists, or simple document like formats, Jottlr will let you do it with its built in theme editor.
